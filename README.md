# Deep Learning Lab
Some of the lab examples and exercises of my deep learning lectures. 

## Examples

In the [Examples](Examples/) section there are some examples for the [MNIST](Examples/MNIST), [CIFAR10](Examples/CIFAR) and [Time Series](Example/Timeseries) datasets.

## Exercises

In the [Exercises](Exercises/) section there are some proposed exercises for the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

## Recommendations

Use [Googe Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run the experiments in virtual machines equiped with K80 GPUs just in case you don't have a GPU computer to run them.

Some questions about Google Colab? Check [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/fast-ai-lesson-1-on-google-colab-free-gpu-d2af89f53604) post
