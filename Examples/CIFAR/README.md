# CIFAR 10 Examples

Some Keras examples over the CIFAR10 dataset

## Example 1

Convolutional network with Batch Norm, Gaussian Noise regularizer and Learning Rate sceduler.

Python code: [here](1_cifar_conv.py)

## Example 2

Data Augmentation is performed to increase virtually the training set using **known** transformations

Python code: [here](2_cifar_DA.py)

## Example 3

Data Augmentation with more options and feature normalization, note the testdatagen object to deal with feature normalization over test data

Python code: [here](3_cifar_DA2.py)
